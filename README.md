# Franc Tech

Franc Tech is a polished static site for comparison-driven technology reviews and roundups. The project includes dedicated pages for the home experience, blog highlights, contact inquiries, and required legal policies.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Home page featuring hero messaging, service highlights, and newsletter signup.
- `blog.html` — Latest comparison spotlights arranged in a responsive grid with a service callout.
- `vacuum-cleaners-2025.html` — In-depth 2025 vacuum cleaner roundup covering stick, robot, and upright categories.
- `contact.html` — Inquiry form and partnership details for brands, agencies, and readers.
- `terms.html` — Terms & Conditions governing site usage.
- `privacy.html` — Privacy Policy outlining data practices.
- `assets/styles.css` — Global styling for typography, layout, cards, forms, and responsive behavior.

## Getting started
Serve the site locally with any static file server. For example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
